# Rube Goldberg Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

### Developed by Blessing Orazulume

### Headset
This was developed for HTC Vive. To test it, you can get the build folder [here](https://github.com/blessingoraz/rube-goldberg-VR-game/tree/master/RubeGame.app/Contents)

### Hour Spent
50 hours.

### What was interesting about the project
 It was a lot different from the cardboard VR, the immersive experience was amazing and I especially love the teleportation part of the project.
 
### What I found challenging
Working on a lot of scripts and testing my app since I didn't have the Vive device was really challenging.

## Versions
- Unity 2017.2.0f3
